# Spotify Ad Muter
This project uses the Spotipy library to connect to Spotify, and then mutes the computer during ad cycles.
## Intialization
1. Create a `creds.json` file with the client id and secret you receive from your Spotify developer account.
2. Modify the path of this `creds.json` file to be relative to your machine.
3. The first time you run the `spotipy_ad_muter.py` script, it will open a URL. Copy this URL into the terminal when promopted.
4. You may need to restart the program, and then you should be good.
## Additional Info
1. The `spotify.command` file is a terminal script that will open Spotify online and this ad muter in one click. This is for Mac. Modify as needed.
